## Introduction

This repository contains the source code for the ToDoList app, an Android application built entirely from scratch using Jetpack Compose. The app is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently with a modern, clean UI and smooth animations.

## Technologies and Concepts

During the development of the ToDoList app, we explored a variety of modern Android development techniques and technologies, including:

- **Jetpack Compose**: A modern toolkit for building native UIs declaratively.
- **Composable Lifecycle**: Understanding the lifecycle of composable functions.
- **State Management**: Utilizing state in Jetpack Compose to manage UI data.
- **Side Effects**: Handling side effects within composables.
- **Custom Layouts and Components**: Designing flexible layouts and custom UI components.
- **ROOM Database**: Integrating a robust SQLite database solution for local data storage.
- **Compose Navigation**: Implementing navigation between different composables.
- **ViewModels and SharedViewModels**: Managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.
- **Dagger-Hilt**: Dependency injection to provide a scalable way to manage object creation.
- **Preferences DataStore**: Using Jetpack DataStore for handling user preferences.
- **Themes**: Supporting dynamic dark and light themes.
- **Animations**: Adding animations to enhance user interaction, including a custom animated splash screen and swipe-to-delete animations.
- **Clean Architecture**: Structuring the app to ensure scalability, maintainability, and testability.
- **MVVM Pattern**: Implementing Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) to separate UI from business logic.
- **Transition Animations**: Creating fluid motion transitions between UI states.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Create, edit, and delete tasks.
- **Task Prioritization**: Mark tasks as important.
- **Dark and Light Modes**: Automatically adjusts based on system settings or user preference.
- **Animated Feedback**: Visual cues for task interactions.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored locally and persist across app launches.
